</li>

</li>

</ul>
We have a few channels which are only visible to the <span class="administrator">Admin</span>/ <span class="moderator">Moderators</span>.  We'll leave them to your imagination ;)

## Nicknames

Members are welcome to change their own nickname as long as they stay within the rules and use latin character set and don't use zalgo.  We need to be able to type usernames in without added complexity.

## Our bots

<li> <span class="trustedbot">@Mee6<!--#4876-->'s</span> main task is to track member contributions by giving you a slightly random amount of experience points once in each minute you chat here. After defined steps of experience, you "level up" and get a message by it telling you that. Some levels unlock a role that gets assigned to your user automatically by the bot (for details see the section about roles and permissions). Other than that, the levels are just a nice indicator of your activity.
